    * Avoid saving history to disk, by directly stream the history output to 
    indicator constructing.

    * Only use a single CIMB history server, to avoid extensive server 
    pooling if the history data cannot be found. However, we will be facing 
    inaccurate data risk.

    indicators being triggered.
