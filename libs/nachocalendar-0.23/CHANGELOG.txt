NachoCalendar ChangeLog
=========================


Version 0.23, with release_0-0-1 tag
2010/07/01   Having extra space around wording "Mon", "Tue", ... so that they
             won't stick together.
             Use light weighted color for "Mon", "Tue", ... labels background.
             Bug fixed on HeaderPanel's getPreferredSize, so that in Chinese
